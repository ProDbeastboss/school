            A man decided to start a chicken farm and brought 24 to get started. A week later he bought another 24 and another 24 the week after that. When his friend asked how his chicken farm was coming along the man replied, <em>"Not one of them has grown yet. I wonder if I'm planting them too deep?"</em>
